### Accessibility
I am an advocate for accessibility (A11y). My focus is on web development with HTML 5, CSS 2/3, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP 8.*+ and mySQL. My intent is to create a class to handle creation, validation and processing of forms and ensure that the forms are accessible and responsive.

### Learning
I am always learning new things about the technologies that I use and about accessibility standards. My intent here is to create a place where I can maintain sources of learning to assist myself and others.

### Development
Along with the form class I intend to work on, I may add additional projects as they occur to me. The work that I create in public repositories is intended to be licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0 unless otherwise noted in the individual repository.
